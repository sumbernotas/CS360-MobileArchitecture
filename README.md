# Requirements
For this class, I chose to develop the "Event Tracking App" with the following requirements
A database with at least two tables, one to store the event details and one to store user logins and passwords
 A screen for logging into the app
 
Note that the screen for logging into the app should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
A screen with a grid , that displays all upcoming events

A mechanism by which the user can add and remove events from the database

A mechanism by which the user can enter the time and general information of a specific event

A mechanism by which the application will notify the user on the day that an event has been scheduled

# Design
To design the basic layout of the application, I used Figma. I took in the user requirements and made multiple screens to ensure each requirement was being met, all while keeping a consistent design. The design for the application worked well as it was user-friendly and only had what was needed to make the application functional. Not too overwhelming, but quite simplistic

# Development and Testing
My process of developing the application was to take one thing at a time. I focused one screen and its functionality before moving onto the next. This allowed me to test each screen, starting from the home screen, to ensure it worked as needed. I would test the application directly on my personal phone from Android Studio so that I could get a good idea of what the app would look like from a users perspective. This was a vital part of my development as it ensured the application truly worked as it was suppose to. It would allow me to easily catch bugs and make changes from there.
